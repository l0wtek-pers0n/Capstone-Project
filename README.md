Project Description
This project aims to research and build tools to support network system penetration testing. By leveraging both open-source tools and custom-built functions, we will create a tool called PenNet to assess the security of network infrastructures, including Ethernet, switches, routers, and WiFi. The project will focus on building a virtual network infrastructure to simulate real-world environments and will run on a Linux platform to maximize compatibility.

Objectives
Understand the process of penetration testing for network infrastructures, including Ethernet and WiFi.
Build a virtual network environment using tools like GNS3 to simulate small business networks for testing.
Develop and integrate open-source tools, such as Nmap, Airgedon, Aircrack-ng, Krack, Frag, and Wifijammer, into the PenNet tool.
Create a user-friendly interface to support penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and device network attacks.
Assess and recommend security improvements for network devices.

Features of PenNet Tool
Eye-catching, easy-to-use interface.
Network device lookup and testing functionality.
Integration of open-source tools for comprehensive testing.
Ethical usage warnings to prevent misuse.
Port scanning and network device vulnerability testing.
Linux-based for optimal performance.
Penetration Testing Process
Collect Project Information: Approach clients and plan.
Network Infrastructure Check: Scan the network for vulnerabilities.
Identify Targets: Choose devices to attack.
Exploit Vulnerabilities: Test the weaknesses identified.
Report Findings: Provide a detailed vulnerability assessment and recommend security measures.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Penetrate the company's wireless network.
Scenario 2: Scan and test the network devices.
Network Diagram
The network model for testing will be built using GNS3, simulating a small business infrastructure.

Advantages
User-friendly interface with command and panel options.
Effective tools for looking up and testing network devices.
Supports Linux for smooth operation.
Disadvantages
Requires a WiFi adapter with monitoring capability.
Limited to Linux; cannot run on Windows.
Ethical concerns due to potential misuse.
Fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity is necessary.
Ethical Considerations
Penetration testing is performed strictly within the legal boundaries and with the client's permission, following a structured pentest process. This ensures ethical usage of the tool for security purposes only.

Conclusion
The PenNet tool will be a comprehensive solution for network penetration testing, integrating custom functions and open-source tools to evaluate and enhance network security policies for small businesses.
