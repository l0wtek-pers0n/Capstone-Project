# Capstone-Project
RESEARCH AND BUILD TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE NETWORK SYSTEM PENETRATION TESTING PROCESS

Description
This project aims to research and build tools for network system penetration testing. By leveraging both open-source tools and custom-built functions, we will create a tool called PenNet to assess the security of network infrastructures, including Ethernet, switches, routers, and WiFi. The project will focus on building a virtual network infrastructure to simulate real-world environments and will run on a Linux platform to maximize compatibility.

Tools and Technologies
PenNet Tool: Built-in Python, optimized for Linux
Open-Source Tools:
Nmap
Airgedon
Aircrack-ng
Krack
