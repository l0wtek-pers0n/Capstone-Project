# Capstone-Project
RESEARCH AND BUILD TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE NETWORK SYSTEM PENETRATION TESTING PROCESS

Description
This project aims to research and build tools for network system penetration testing. By leveraging both open-source tools and custom-built functions, we will create a tool called PenNet to assess the security of network infrastructures, including Ethernet, switches, routers, and WiFi. The project will focus on building a virtual network infrastructure to simulate real-world environments and will run on a Linux platform to maximize compatibility.

Objectives
Understand the process of penetration testing for network infrastructures, including Ethernet and WiFi.
Build a virtual network environment using tools like GNS3 to simulate small business networks for testing.
Develop and integrate open-source tools, such as Nmap, Airgedon, Aircrack-ng, Krack, Frag, and Wifijammer, into the PenNet tool.
Create a user-friendly interface to support penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and device network attacks.
Assess and recommend security improvements for network devices.
